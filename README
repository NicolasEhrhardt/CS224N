I implemented two version of each model: one version not optimized, and a second optimized version (with "Parallel" suffix). The optimized version is multi-threaded and its efficiency will depend on your machine. Modify the variable njobs according to the number of cores you have.

To run: make sure that the variable DATA_PATH in the code is poiting to the right folder.

test.sh: script to test the algorithm with in the given parameters
testall.sh: generates the learning curves for the extra question.

NOTE: log/ contains the log files of my last run to create the learning curves.
